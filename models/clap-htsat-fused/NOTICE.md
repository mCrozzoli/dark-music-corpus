# CLAP model files — notice

These files come from **`laion/clap-htsat-fused`** by **LAION** (https://huggingface.co/laion/clap-htsat-fused), the
Hugging Face port of LAION-CLAP's 630k-audioset fusion model, prepared for the Dark Music Corpus web tool on 2026-10-23:

- `audio_model_int8.onnx` — the audio encoder (HTSAT, with its projection) exported to ONNX (torch.onnx, opset 17) for
  clips up to 10 s (every clip here: the "fusion" input is the same mel spectrogram four times, is_longer false), weights
  quantised to 8 bits. Against the original model: cosine ≥ 0.988, median 0.995 (30 clips of the demo corpus).
- `text_model_int8.onnx.part0` + `.part1` — the text encoder (with its projection), exported the same way, quantised per
  channel (signed, reduced range); split in two only to stay under GitHub's file-size limit (the page joins them).
  Against the original: cosine ≥ 0.962, median 0.981 (30 prompts). The tokenizer is the RoBERTa BPE in
  `../clap/tokenizer/` (byte-identical to this checkpoint's).
