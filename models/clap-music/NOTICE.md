# CLAP model files — notice

`audio_model_int8.onnx` comes from **`laion/larger_clap_music`** by **LAION** (https://huggingface.co/laion/larger_clap_music),
prepared for the Dark Music Corpus web tool on 2026-10-23: the audio encoder (with its projection) exported to ONNX
(torch.onnx, opset 17) from the Hugging Face Transformers model, weights quantised to 8 bits (ONNX Runtime dynamic
quantisation). Against the original model: audio embeddings cosine ≥ 0.9994 (30 clips of the demo corpus).

Only the audio side ships: this checkpoint's text side maps every prompt to almost the same vector (mean pairwise
cosine 0.999), so the page turns the text probe and text tags off for it, as the desktop engine does.
